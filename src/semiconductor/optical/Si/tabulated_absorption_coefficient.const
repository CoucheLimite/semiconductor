[Schinke_2015]
model: Si_Schinke_2015
temp: 295
notes: determined from the combination of ellipometry, spectral luminescence,
    and spectral response measurements all measured specifcally for this project.
    The uncertainty in the absorption coefficienct was also calculated

[Schinke_2014]
model: Si_Schinke_2014
doi: 10.1063/1.4866916
temp: 295
notes: a relative measured determined from spectral luminescence measurements

[Nguyen_2014]
model: Si_Nguyen_2014
temp: 78 to 363 K
default_temp: 300
doi: 10.1063/1.4862912
notes: determined the absorptance from spectral luminescence at a range of different temperatures.
    However this measurement was done at a the high injection level of 1e17, meaning band gap naorrowing is
    ofccuring.

[Wang_2013]
model: Si_Wang_2013
temp: 300
doi: 10.1007/s10765-013-1414-2
notes: Review of Si models and tabulated data, and measures their own values
  of different thickness using T data, with calculated reflectance.
  They find Greens tabulated data and Geist model agree within
  3-7 percent, even through they come from different data sources.

[Green_2008]
model: Si_Green_2008
temp: 300
doi: 10.1016/j.solmat._2008.06.009
notes: determined from the combination of published ellipometry
    and spectral response measurements. The Kramersâ€“Kronig relation was enforced
    to improve the determination of k/alpha

[Grivickas_2003]
model = Si_Grivickas_2003
temp: 297
doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.246401
notes: determined from the carrier distribution in a wafer
    from free carrier absorption measurements.

doi: 10.1002/pip.4670030303
notes: determined from the combination of published ellipometry
    and spectral response measurements.

model: Si_Daub_1995
temp: 295
doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.10_20, 10.1109/JPHOTOV._2013.2263985
notes: a relative measured determined from spectral luminesecnece measurements. Data taken from
    Fig 4. The tabulated data was obtained by Schinke and made publically avilable
